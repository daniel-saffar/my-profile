		<h2>Business & Management skills</h2>

			<p> After 3 years of an intense educational program in France studying Economy, Mathematics & Philosophy, I entered a top-business school : EDHEC.</p>

		<h2>Lifestyle</h2>

		<p>I am passionate about calisthenics. A particular kind of workout which uses gravity and bodyweight to develop strenght and endurance. </p> 

		<p> I also love basketball, a sport I've been practicing for over 10 years. Besides the physical and technical aspect I love about this sport, I enjoy the 5 heads per team format. I think it is the perfect quantity to ensure both diversity and homogeneity in a group to pursue shared goals. </p>

		<p> If you accidentally ran into me during my spare time, there are good chances that I would be cooking at that very moment. Always looking to improve my nutrition (quality and taste), I keep testing new recipes and then force my roommate to eat it. </p>
